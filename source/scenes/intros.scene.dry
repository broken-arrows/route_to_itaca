= The Revolution of February 1917

On International Women's Day, 1917, mass marches of hungry women filled the streets of Petrograd, the capital city of the Russian Empire. They demanded bread and peace, and the end of the Tsarist autocracy. Workers joined the protests, and the marches grew to a general strike shutting the entire city. Soldiers were ordered to suppress the marches with force; they refused, turning against their officers instead.

Now, the hated Tsar Nicholas II has abdicated, and a new Provisional Government has been formed among Duma representatives. Meanwhile, the striking workers and mutinous soldiers of Petrograd have organized the Soviet, a committee of socialist workers' representatives that is somewhere between a coordinating body and a government.

It seems that for now, anything is possible. The established order is gone. A new world is ready to be built.

= The Abdication of the Tsar

The Tsar has been convinced that his abdication is the only way to save Russia from civil war, and thus has abdicated in favor of his brother, Grand Duke Michael. However, Grand Duke Michael also sees the position as tsar to be untenable, and thus has refused to take the crown

Now, the reign of the Tsar is over, and power is vested in the Provisional Government.

= The Petrograd Soviet

The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is an elected council comprised of representatives of workers and soldiers throughout the city. Organized in the wake of the general strike and the breakdown of the established order, it harkens back to the Petrograd Soviet of 1905, which functioned as an alternative government in the city during the revolution.

The leaders of the Soviet, mostly Social Democrat and SR intellectuals, have organized an Executive Committee, and elected the Menshevik Nikolai Chkheidze as the chairman. They see its goal as ending the general strike and advocating for the workers and soldiers, acting as a watchdog over the bourgeois Provisional Government. They command the workers and soldiers to go back to work, and to obey the Provisional Government insofar as it does not disobey the directives of the Soviet.

= Restoring Order to the Army

The army is in revolt. Soldiers in Petrograd have largely shaken off their officers and commanders, and are currently answering to no higher authority except ad-hoc committees of soldiers. The unrest is spreading in the army, and might soon reach the front.

# Source for Order Number 1: the full text is at https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/1917/03/01.htm

To restore order to the army, the Petrograd Soviet is considering issuing an order to the soldiers of the city garrison, promising certain concessions in exchange for obeying their officers and the Provisional Government.

Which points should be included in the order?

@o1_soviet_menu

- @o1_committees: There will be elected soldiers' committees, which will control the distribution of weapons.
- @o1_address: Soldiers can no longer be verbally abused by the officers, and they must be addressed by respectful terms.
- @o1_rights: Soldiers will have the same rights as ordinary citizens when off-duty, including the right to participate in elections.
- @o1_issue: This should be enough; issue the order!

In addition to these points, we have declared that the orders of the Provisional Government must be carried out, unless they contradict the orders of the Soviet, and made provisions for elections of soldiers' representatives to the Soviet.

The order succeeds in ending the immediate chaos in the Petrograd garrison. Soldiers return to their barracks.

In response to the soldiers' revolts, the Petrograd Soviet has issued Order Number 1, which creates soldiers' committees, gives off-duty soldiers the same rights as civilians, and bans derogatory forms of address against soldiers by their officers.

The Bolsheviks are pleased with this order, as it contributes to the democratization of the army, and gives Bolshevik organizers an easier route to organize among the troops.

In response to the soldiers' disorder, the Petrograd Soviet has issued Order Number 1, which creates soldiers' committees, gives off-duty soldiers the same rights as civilians, and bans derogatory forms of address against soldiers by their officers.

The Kadets are generally displeased with this order, as it can lead to a breakdown in military discipline.

= The Provisional Government

With the abdication of the Tsar, power in Russia has been transferred to the Provisional Government, comprised primarily of liberal members of the Duma and led by Prince Georgy Lvov, a reformist noble. The government has already been recognized by the powers of the Entente.

The leaders of the Provisional Government see its role as continuing to persecute the war and maintaining stability until an elected Constituent Assembly is ready to decide Russia's final form of government.

@pg_k

The Kadets, that is our party, have the leading role in the Provisional Government.

@pg_sr
go-to: dual_gov

The Provisional Government is led by the Kadets, or Constitutional Democrats, a liberal party. Alexander Kerensky, a Duma deputy, is the one self-declared socialist member (as Minister of Justice).

= The Conduct of the War

Even as the revolution progresses, the Great War continues as before. All sectors of Russian society argue that the Tsar and his advisors failed to lead the country in the war. Tsar Nicholas, his German-born wife Alexandra, and her widely-loathed "friend" Rasputin have become symbols of the failure and corruption of the established order. Their reign led to defeats, to hunger, to betrayal.

With the Tsar gone, it is hoped that the new Provisional Government would be able to persecute the war more effectively. There is an outburst of patriotic sentiment even among socialists, some of whom now see the war as a defense of freedom and revolution. Even so, many are hoping to end the war as soon as possible. The "Internationalists" are calling for the workers of all countries to fight for a just peace, even if it means revolting against their own governments.

@war_k
go-to: intro_menu

More than the socialists, the Kadets support the war effort. Some in our party wish to stay in the war for the sake of the Allies, some wish to fight for freedom and democracy, and others are full-blown Russian nationalists who want Russia to conquer all the way to Constantinople.

@war_b
go-to: intro_menu

The position of the Bolsheviks is and has always been internationalism, to end the war by means of an international socialist revolution of the working class. Exiled party leader Vladimir Lenin was one of the chief figures of the Zimmerwald Conference in Switzerland, where anti-war socialists from all belligerents called for an end to war. At one point he argued in support of "revolutionary defeatism", a policy to turn imperialist war into civil war.

The goal of all Russian revolutionaries, liberal or socialist, is to hold elections for the Constituent Assembly, the representative body that will decide Russia's new form of government. Until then, the Provisional Government's leaders must decide how to deal with the myriad problems facing the country today.
